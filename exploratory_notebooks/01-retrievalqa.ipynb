    "The purpose of this notebook is to trial the usage of `RetrievalQA` for question answering in our current use case.  I'll be working mainly from these two examples: [example 1](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/) & [example 2](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/how_to/vector_db_qa).\n",

    "# Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this example is stored in `data/vector-db/` and it stores finanical posts and top comments from many of reddit's top financial subreddits, as described in `00-data-import.ipynb`.  The vectorstore was embedded using `all-mpnet-base-v2` from HF and so that'll be loaded and provided as well."
