    "The purpose of this notebook is to explore the usage of a Conversational Retrieval Agent from `langchain` for our use case.  The agent will allow the LLM to determine when to query the database and when not to.  I'm mainly working from the following examples: [example from documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/how_to/conversational_retrieval_agents), [blog post example](https://blog.langchain.dev/conversational-retrieval-agents/).\n",
