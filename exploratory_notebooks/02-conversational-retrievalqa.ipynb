    "# Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to iterate on the previous notebook (`01-retrievalqa.ipynb`) by adding history to enable a chat interface for question answering with our current use case.  I'll be working mainly from the following two examples: [`ConversationalRetrievalQA` example](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/how_to/chat_vector_db), [manual example](https://www.dbdemos.ai/minisite/llm-dolly-chatbot/).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Vector Store\n",
    "The dataset for this example is stored in `data/vector-db/` and it stores finanical posts and top comments from many of reddit's top financial subreddits, as described in `00-data-import.ipynb`.  The vectorstore was embedded using `all-mpnet-base-v2` from HF and so that'll be loaded and provided as well."

    "The issue with storing conversation history is that at some point, attaching the entirety of the chat history will exceed the token limit of the LLM query.  To counteract this, we'll use an LLM to summarize the chat history before attaching to the prompt.  Langchain has options for handling this, including `ConversationSummaryMemory` and `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`.  The main difference is that the former summarizes the chat history over time, while the latter stores the entire history and summarizes each time, using token length to determine when to flush.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, open ai works extremely well for the chat summarization task and Llama 2 works ok but is prone to some bizarre hallucinations at times.  With some hyperparameter adjustments, Llama 2 may work better.  The reason I can't use a more simple summarization model for this taks is because it's more of a one shot learning example.  Both memory functions above actually attach an example of the chat summarization task to the prompt before sending to the LLM and so it takes a rather sophisticated LLM to summarize in the intended fashion.
